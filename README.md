## How it Works
14% of Maker CDPs to date have been forcibly liquidated. When this happens, the ETH held as collateral in the CDP is automatically sold at a 3% discount to pay off the CDP holder's DAI debt, and on top of this a 13% liquidation penalty is applied.

When ETH prices drop, many CDP holders can't afford to top up their CDP with ETH to prevent liquidation; but often, they donâ€™t have enough cash to buy DAI close their CDP. So even though they may still be collateralised at over 150% (i.e. they have sufficient assets to pay back their debt), there is no way to effectively close their CDP and pay back the debt.

How can we allow these users to close their CDP without paying a hefty liquidation fee? Introducing... $dai daddy - an autonomous platform for buying and selling Maker CDPs. Sellers can list their CDP for sale and offer a "discount rate" - less than the 13% fee they would have to pay if forcibly liquidated - which incentivises buyers to provide capital upfront and buy out the seller's debt.

Our smart contract manages the sale and purchase process, taking ownership of the CDP and custody of the funds, and settling the agreement between the parties in a single transaction.
